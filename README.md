# Introduction
The dataset consists of the responses to a survey published by Nature Journal in 2022 about the conditions, prospects, worries, etc. experienced by graduate students currently involved in their program.

There were a total of 3252 responses from 89 countries, and the survey was comprised of 221 multiple-option questions.

Using R, the data set has been cleaned, split, and filtered to facilitate the analysis of the data, whose results have been graphically displayed.

# Content
Due to the large volume of the data, the dataset was divided into several sub-datasets to facilitate their study. After the split, each sub-dataset was cleaned, leaving aside outliers that might have corrupted the presentation of the data in a graphical form.

Then, questions of interest were answered through graphs involving the corresponding section of the original data.

# Results
The different graphs we obtained after the whole process provided diverse insight into the demographical characteristics of the respondents, their economic situation, hardships, satisfactions, workload, and learnings.

Some notable conclusions are:
- The majority of master's students are located in China.
- International students are more abundant in the Netherlands.
- Less than half of graduate students will not pursue a career in academia.
- Surprisingly, there is not much preoccupation about acquired student debt.
