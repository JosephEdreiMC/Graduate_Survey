# Introduction
The dataset consists of the responses to a survey published by Nature Journal in 2022 about the conditions, prospects, worries, etc. experienced by graduate students currently involved in their program.

There were a total of 3252 responses from 89 countries, and the survey was comprised of 221 multiple-option questions.

Using R, the data set has been cleaned, split, and filtered to facilitate the analysis of the data, whose results have been graphically displayed.

# Content
Due to the large volume of the data, the dataset was divided into several sub-datasets to facilitate their study. After the split, each sub-dataset was cleaned, leaving aside outliers that might have corrupted the presentation of the data in a graphical form.

Then, questions of interest were answered through graphs involving the corresponding section of the original data.
